# Fibo Game Read Me
## Introduction

This react app was created as part of an interview challenge. The challenge had multiple conditions highlited below

- create a 50 x 50 grid
- increment entire row and column of cell clicked by 1
- incremented cells must flash yellow momentarily
- if 5 numbers in the fibonacci sequence are next to each other these cells will briefly turn green and be cleared

## Run Program

- clone the repo
- save it to your local machine
- open in source code editor
- npm run start

## How to play

- click on the cells with a mouse to increment cells.
- Initial value of all cells is 0
- best played on computer
- refresh restarts progress

## Notes

- To create the board I used a 2d array.
- I used a turnery operator with 3 options to change cell colour. 
- To clear a cell I turned it into a string
- I sacrificed a goat to get the visuals to work
- if played long enough numbers may exceed cell size
- I didn't have enough goats
